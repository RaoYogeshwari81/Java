The Main method which the java application contains is Public static void main

Public class so its useable gloabally 
static means if we want to access the class object and method it is used because it dont needs to be intialized but also we can use it.
void is a return type it means it will not return any thing
main is a method.

Primitive data type Primitive data structure is the data structure that allows you to store only single data type values

Byte
Short
Integer
Long
Float
Double
Boolean
Character

String
StringBuffer
StringBuilder
Date
Array
etc....

Non Primitive data 
Non-Primitive data structure is a data structure that allows you to store multiple data type values. integer, boolean, character, float, etc. are some examples of primitive data structures
Class


2) The classes which are made up of primitive data type is known as wrapper class
3) The biggest data type is String.
4) String is a collection of character or array of character.
5) If you store any value in character or string data type and print it then it will return the ascii value of character.
6) String[] in public static void main takes the value from the console(CMD).
7) Why wrapper class is needed ? It have value of whole class object
8) Java have all thing in class
9) difference between byte and Byte class 
byte -> allocates 1 byte by default.
Byte -> it's wrapper class and it have whole class object bytes

10) Difference between wrapper class and data type?
-> Wrapper takes the whole object memory and also gives the all functionality of that class While, Data type have only single form if select int then int .
