1) What is primitive data type?
=> Primitive data types are the most basic data types provided by the language, and they are not objects.They represent simple values. 
   There are eight primitive data types in Java:
   1) byte
   2) short 
   3) int
   4) long
   5) float
   6) double 
   7) char
   8) boolean
   It always starts with small letter.
=> The term "Primitive data type" refers to a data structure capable of storing singular data type values.

2) What is Non-primitive data type ? 
=>Non-primitive data structures are data structures that enable the storage of multiple data type values. 
Examples of non-primitive data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. 
These structures are capable of holding elements of various types, such as integers, booleans, characters, floats, and 
more.
	1) String
	2) StringBuffer
	3) StringBuilder
	4) Date
	5) Array etc....
   
3) What is Wrapper class ?
=> The classes which are composed(made up) of primitive data types are known as wrapper classes.
The value of a wrapper class object encompasses the entirety of the class, including its attributes, methods, and behaviors.   	

4) What is difference between Wrapper class and primitive data type ?
=> A wrapper class encapsulates the entire object's memory, offering all functionalities of the associated class. Conversely, primitive data types possess only 
a singular form; for instance, selecting "int" will remain solely as "int."
